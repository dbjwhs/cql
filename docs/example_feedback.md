# API Integration Feedback Template

This document provides a structured template for offering feedback on the CQL API integration. Please use this format when providing comments, suggestions, or concerns about the implementation plan.

## Overall Feedback

*Add your general thoughts on the approach, major concerns, or priorities here.*

Example:
```
The overall direction looks promising. I particularly like the phased approach to implementation.
However, I'm concerned about the security aspects of API key management and would like to see this
addressed more thoroughly in Phase 1 rather than later phases.
```

## Document-Specific Feedback

### API Integration Roadmap

*Provide feedback on the implementation plan, timeline, and phases.*

Example:
```
- Phase 1 timeline seems optimistic. Consider extending to 4 weeks instead of 2-3.
- Add explicit mention of rate limiting handling to Phase 1 
- The dependency on libcurl may be problematic for some environments - consider alternatives
```

### API Client Specification

*Comment on the API client design, class structure, and proposed features.*

Example:
```
- The class structure looks clean, but the ApiResponse might benefit from additional methods
  for checking specific response conditions
- Add support for streaming responses in the initial implementation rather than as an extension point
- Consider using the pImpl pattern for implementation hiding to improve binary compatibility
```

### Response Processor Specification

*Provide feedback on the response parsing, code extraction, and file generation logic.*

Example:
```
- The filename determination logic needs to account for nested directory structures
- Add support for detecting and handling license requirements in the generated code
- The language mapping looks good, but consider adding mappings for less common languages
```

### CLI Integration Examples

*Comment on the command-line interface, options, and example usage.*

Example:
```
- Add examples for batch processing multiple queries
- Consider adding a '--dry-run' option that shows what would be generated without API calls
- The interactive mode should support saving responses for later reference
```

## Prioritization

*Indicate which aspects of the implementation should be prioritized.*

Example:
```
1. Security features (API key management)
2. Basic API integration with proper error handling
3. Response processing and file generation
4. Advanced CLI features
```

## Additional Suggestions

*Provide any other ideas, features, or considerations that weren't covered in the original specifications.*

Example:
```
- Consider integration with version control systems for generated code
- Add telemetry features to track API usage (with privacy controls)
- Support for "conversation" mode where followup queries can reference earlier code
```

## Implementation Concerns

*Note any technical challenges or implementation difficulties you foresee.*

Example:
```
- Parsing Markdown code blocks reliably might be challenging
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing CQL usage
- Threading model for async operations needs careful consideration
```

*When completed, please share this feedback with the development team for review and implementation.*
