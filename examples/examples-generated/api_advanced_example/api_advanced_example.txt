Please generate C++ code that:
implement a distributed task scheduler with worker nodes and a central coordinator

Context:
- Modern C++20 implementation with concepts and coroutines
- Designed for cloud deployment

Architecture Requirements:
- Message-based architecture
- Fault-tolerant with node failure recovery
- Horizontally scalable with dynamic worker addition/removal
- Load balancing across worker nodes

Dependencies:
- Networking library (e.g., Boost.Asio)
- JSON serialization (e.g., nlohmann/json)
- Message queue protocol

Performance Requirements:
- Handle 100k+ tasks per second
- Low latency task distribution (<5ms)

Security Requirements:
- Secure communication between nodes with JWT
- Protection against message tampering

Model Parameters:
- Max Tokens: 100000
- Temperature: 0.7
- Output Format: multiple_files

Design Patterns:
- Observer pattern for task status updates
- Factory pattern for task creation
- Strategy pattern for scheduling algorithms

File Structure:
- include/scheduler_core.hpp: Core scheduler interface and data structures
- include/worker_node.hpp: Worker node implementation
- include/message_queue.hpp: Message queue interface
- include/security_manager.hpp: Security and authentication
- src/scheduler_implementation.cpp: Scheduler implementation
- src/worker_implementation.cpp: Worker implementation
- src/message_queue.cpp: Message queue implementation
- src/security_implementation.cpp: Security implementation
- tests/tests.cpp: Comprehensive test suite

Please include tests for the following cases:
- Test worker node registration and heartbeat
- Test task submission and completion
- Test fault tolerance with worker node failure
- Test load balancing across workers
- Test scaling with multiple workers
- Test security with authentication and authorization

Quality Assurance Requirements:
- All code must be well-documented with comments
- Follow modern C++ best practices
- Ensure proper error handling
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
