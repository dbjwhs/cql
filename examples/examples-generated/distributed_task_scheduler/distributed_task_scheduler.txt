Please generate C++ code that:
implement a distributed task scheduler with real-time monitoring

Context:
- Modern C++20 implementation using coroutines
- System must work in a cloud-native environment

Architecture Requirements:
- Microservices with message queue for task distribution
- Each worker node is responsible for reporting its status

Constraints:
- Must handle network partitioning gracefully
- Recovery time < 5 seconds after failure

Dependencies:
- boost::asio, std::coroutine
- nlohmann::json for message serialization

Performance Requirements:
- Process up to 10,000 tasks per second distributed across nodes
- 99th percentile latency < 50ms for task submission

Security Requirements:
- All network traffic must be encrypted with TLS 1.3+
- Role-based access control for task submission

Algorithmic Complexity Requirements:
- O(log n) for task scheduling decisions
- O(1) for status updates from worker nodes

Please reference these examples:
Example - Task Definition:
```

struct Task {
    std::string id;
    std::string type;
    nlohmann::json payload;
    std::chrono::system_clock::time_point deadline;
    uint8_t priority;
};

```

Example - Status Update:
```

struct NodeStatus {
    std::string node_id;
    double cpu_load;
    uint64_t memory_used;
    uint32_t tasks_queued;
    uint32_t tasks_processing;
    std::array<uint8_t, 3> health_indicators;
};

```

Please include tests for the following cases:
- Worker node failure and recovery
- Load balancing with heterogeneous worker capabilities
- Priority-based task scheduling
- Deadline satisfaction rate > 99.9%
- Security access control tests
- Performance under simulated high-load conditions

Quality Assurance Requirements:
- All code must be well-documented with comments
- Follow modern C++ best practices
- Ensure proper error handling
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
