Please generate C++ code that:
Thread-safe vector implementation with synchronization

Context:
- Using C++20 memory model and atomics

Architecture Requirements:
- Thread-safe implementation with shared mutex

Dependencies:
- std::shared_mutex, std::atomic

Performance Requirements:
- Lower contention through optimistic reads

Security Requirements:
- Prevent data races through proper synchronization

Please include tests for the following cases:
- Test concurrent read operations
